# Hi there, I'm [Kil Gyu Cheol]! 👋

I am a **Software Engineering student** at Soonchunhyang University and a graduate of the **6th Game Institute (GIG)** program. I focus on high-performance graphics and efficient real-time simulations.

I enjoy the process of solving technical challenges at the hardware level, particularly in how the GPU can be leveraged to create fluid visual experiences.
