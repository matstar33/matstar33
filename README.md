# Hi there, I'm [Kil Gyu Cheol]! 👋

I’m a **Software Engineering student** at Soonchunhyang University and a graduate of the **6th Game Institute (GIG)** program. I love exploring the intersection of high-performance engineering and visual storytelling.

Currently, I'm focused on mastering **Real-time Rendering** and finding efficient ways to simulate reality through code.

### 🌟 Featured Project: *Kori: the Spritail*

Developed as a showcase for **G-Star 2025**, this project was a deep dive into GPU-driven simulation.

* **Modular GPU Particle System:** Built a flexible architecture inspired by *Unreal Engine Niagara*.
* **Performance Optimization:** Shifted heavy computation to the GPU using **Compute Shaders**, resulting in a **100-150x performance gain** over CPU implementations.
* **Visual Fidelity:** Focused on creating expressive, high-density VFX that maintain stable frame rates in demanding environments.
